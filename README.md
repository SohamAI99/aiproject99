# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv5  

## Description  
This project implements **real-time object detection** using **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5)**. The model detects multiple objects in an image or video stream with high accuracy and speed.  

The project was developed as part of an **AI/ML internship**, where the goal was to build an efficient **real-time detection system** using deep learning techniques.  

## Features  
- **Real-time object detection** from webcam or video feed.  
- **YOLOv5 pre-trained models** for high-speed, accurate detection.  
- **Supports multiple classes** (e.g., persons, vehicles, animals, objects).  
- **Integration with OpenCV** for video processing.  
- **Custom dataset training (optional)** for specific object detection.  

## Installation
